		<h2 class = "main">About Us</h2>
		<p><span>Welcome to <b>TechSpot</b>, your go-to destination for all things 
		tech! Founded by a group of passionate tech enthusiasts, TechSpot 
		was born out of a shared vision to create a space where innovation, 
		knowledge, and community come together.</span></p>
		
		<h3 class = main-title>What's Our Deal?</h3>
		<p>The idea for TechSpot sparked during a late-night brainstorming 
		session among friends. We realized that while technology was advancing 
		at an unprecedented pace, there was a lack of a centralized platform 
		that made tech insights accessible, engaging, and easy to understand. 
		That’s when we decided to create <b>TechSpot</b>—a hub where curiosity meets 
		expertise.</p>

		<p>The name <b>TechSpot</b> reflects our mission: to be the ultimate "spot" 
		for tech enthusiasts, professionals, and beginners alike. Whether you're 
		looking for the latest trends, in-depth analyses, or practical tips, 
		TechSpot is here to light the way.</p>
